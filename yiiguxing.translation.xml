It appears with a fixed Delta of {UpperLower, UpperLower, UpperLower} The constant UpperLower has an otherwise impossible delta value." />

Further, if any of the send(ProducerRecord) calls which were part of the transaction hit irrecoverable errors, this method will throw the last received exception immediately and the transaction will not be committed. So all send(ProducerRecord) calls in a transaction must succeed in order for this method to succeed. Note that this method will raise TimeoutException if the transaction cannot be committed before expiration of max.block.ms. Additionally, it will raise InterruptException if interrupted. It is safe to retry in either case, but it is not possible to attempt a different operation (such as abortTransaction) since the commit may already be in the progress of completing. If not retrying, the only option is to close the producer." />
